## Problem and Motivation

>The research question addressed in this paper is:\
>R.Q.: Why Do Hardware Startups Fail?\
>Research Objective:\
>Developing sets of logical steps and rules\
>To Process, Collect, Analyze, Manage & Extract the Failure Factors from
>Any Given Data Size, Structure, and Formats

Startups are projects undertaken by an entrepreneur to create, seek, develop, and validate Goods or services, and look for continuous business models to build that product, sell it and recover the cost and profit from it under uncertainty and extreme.


Startup failure is a startup that closes or ceases operations, causing the creditors to lose money, when it is no longer able to turn a profit.


Hardware startups are startups that build everything that has mass, volume, physically tangible; including a physical part of a computer such as CPU, monitor, mouse motherboard, or ware (such as fittings, cutlery, tools, utensils, or parts of machines) made of metal or equipment, especially for industrial, military, or general us.


Hardware startups Failure is Startups failure of product that has mass, volume, and physically tangible.

Hardware startups often failed, it is hard to find successful hardware
startups to start with, however Theranos was a successful hardware
startup, valued at 9 billion U.S dollar. Theranos would be an ideal case
study for a successful hardware startup, but, like most hardware
startups, Theranos ended in a tragic drama.

Theranos's story is the lesson that every hardware startup must learn .
The fall of Theranos is the story of the failure for the most hardware
startups that based on individual convenience, intuition, or
trial-and-error, without any theoretical foundation, scientific models,
or scientific paper.

Repeating the failures is that every hardware startup must be aware of,
especially in the last years, when we have noticed a famous companies
like Intel and Lenovo are leaning toward the hardware startups and
supporting the startups around the globe to build their own hardware.

Putting the hardware startups on the right track requires hard work,
time, and effort that I put in this research, to develop a methodology
and plan to process any given data with any size, types of structure and
format to the answer for the research question that we addressed in this
paper (Why hardware startups fail).

##  Research Process and results

I developed a Startups Diagram, this diagram defines the startups,
startups failures, hardware startups and hardware startups failures. The
Startups Diagram will help us to develop a strategy to identify the
hardware startup failure product and distinguished it from other
startups.

### Data collection and data analysis

I developed strategy to collect and process the data on hardware
startups failure from Gray Literature and CB-Insights.

I developed a strategy to process the data with three phases to answer
the research question (why hardware startups fail). Phase 1 is for data
collection. Phase 2 is for data analysis. Finally Phase 3 is for storing
the research materials. I explain the three phases of the strategy in
the following steps:

**Phase 1: Data Collection**\
Step 1: Define and refine search keywords for Google. Result \[(1,3,6)
Keywords distributed in (Block1, Block2, Block3)\] respectively.\
Step 2: Apply search keywords to the Google search engine. Result
\[43,000,000 units of data\]\
Step 3: Export search results. Result \[580 URLs\].\
Step 4: Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to \[Search Results
Collection A\]. Result \[122 URLs\].\
Step 5: Identify Relevant URLs from \[Search Results Collection B\].
Result \[70 Documents\].\
Step 6: Extract Relevant Cases From \[Document Collection\]. \[Result 18
Cases\].\
Step 7: Include Cases from CB-Insights. Result \[24 Cases\].\
Step 8: Add Case Collection B to Case Collection A. Result \[42
cases\].\
Step 9: Merge the Duplicate Cases in \[Case Collection G\]. Result \[38
Cases\].

**Phase 2: Data Analysis**\
Step 10: Extract the relevant data from \[Case Collection C\]. Result
\[Hardware Startups Information\].\
Step 11: Coding \[Case Collection C\] to identify the failure factors.
Result \[17 Failure Factors\].\
Step 12: Group \[17 Failure Factors\] in categories. Result \[5 Major
Categories\].

**Phase 3: Gilgamesh**\
I created a repository on GitHub and call it Gilgamesh to store the
research materials. It is an open source.

## 	Limitations of the study
The nature of the study and the strategy option made before and during working on this research, impacted not only the research’s results, but also some possible limitations that I already knew them even before start working in this project. 


###	Lack of previous research studies on Hardware startups failures
Finding previous studies related to hardware startups failure will help to learn and understand the current state of the problem. Lack of previous study can serve as an important opportunity to describe the need for further research on (hardware startups fail) and this gap. Indeed, Lack of previous study is so important, it encouraged me to work on this research to discover a new possible way to solve the hardware startups failure problem, and to fill.

### Gray Literature’s Secondary and Self-reported Data Collection
I developed three phases strategy for this research relied on Gray Literature to save time, provide large and higher-quality secondary data, I used thematic analysis to process the data. However, the data represent people interview and their opinions on why hardware startups fail, this limited the study because it is not primary data, moreover I must take what people say and the data it might contain several potentials of bias. 



##  Conclusions, implications of the study and directions for future research
### Conclusion
In this study we provides a taxonomy of context of factors of hardware startups related to both the hardware startups and the researchers and their definitions, classification and collecting and analysis of over 43,000,000 unites of data only in the initial stage, and processing of over 38 case study and 52 content analysis over these failure factors, guidelines on how to choose the choose failure factors based on any set of data, and how to process them by the Thematic analysis tools and determine relevant results, that could express information in a more straightforward way, or in a way that makes the hidden information in the dataset obvious. I present our process as a possible way of establishing a process to generate frequent sets of factors to the fallen hardware startups from data and their context information.

### 	Implications for future research
To modify the current research, I suggest implications for the future work, as the following:
1.	Implications on Thematic Analysis of Video and Audio Data.\
2.	Implications on Adjusting Search Keywords in Gray Literature and Secondary Data.\
These implications will improve the depth and the width of the future research.\



####	Implications on thematic data analysis with video and audio
Considering thematic analysis on video and audio data side by side with text formats to extract study cases and failure factors in video, audio, and text format. The thematic analysis on video and audio data will help the future research to bypass the limitation of Lack of previous research studies on Hardware startups failures and minimizing the risk of using the Self-reported data on hardware startups failures. Thematic analysis on video and audio data gives the opportunity to collect data from different resources. 


#### Implications on Adjusting Search Keywords in Gray Literature
Adjusting Search Keywords in Gray Literature and (Secondary Data), by defining and refine new keywords of the Gray Literature to include the A.I. and IoT hardware startups in the data collection. This new suggestion will move the Gray Literature to the next level to collect data from famous industries like Intel and Ubuntu. This research shared the same interest in A.I. and IoT hardware startups with Intel and Ubuntu.\
Example:  Adjusting Search Keywords in Gray Literature and Secondary Data: \
IoT, AI, CPU, Mouse, Monitor, Keyboard, Headphone, Laptop.
