#### Abstract

- Problem Statement: <br />
  Hardware startups often fail. It is still based on individual convenience, intuition, or trial-and-error, without any theoretical foundation, scientific models, or scientific paper that could address an answer for why do hardware startups fail to improve the future of the hardware startups and the startups in general.
- Research objective:<br />
  The major research question that is answered in this thesis is; why do hardware startups fail. This thesis developed sets or logical rules and steps to extract the factors that cause the failure of the hardware startups from any given data-sets.
- Approach:<br />
  This paper developed sets of logical steps and rules to collect, analysis and process any big data related to research question. We collected the data from Google search engine based on Gray Literature. We set steps of logical rules to include the relevant data and exclude the irrelevant, then we use Thematic analysis tools to: extract case studies from included data, failure factors from case studies. We set logical rules to extract hardware startups information from case study, finally we  set steps of logical rules to categorized the failure factors into identical groups. We store the study material in the research's official repository at GitHub called Gilgamesh.
- Research Finding:<br />
  This paper find: Customer \& Market, Hardware Product \& Experts, Financial, Lack Business Model, and Legal Issue; are the major categories that cause the failure of the hardware startups. Product strategy mistakes are the most frequent fatal failure factor that reflects the complexity of hardware startups. Pricing Cost Issues is the factor that explains in detail why hardware startups are challenging and often fail.
- Contribution:`<br />`
  The uniqueness and originality of this paper will benefit the upcoming researchers on their related work. A large number of databases in this paper can be helpful for IoT, Data science, companies, and institutions relying on hardware startups or Qualitative Data Analysis. Furthermore, this paper also suggests clear guidelines to follow on the database process to accomplish the thematic analysis and the equipment needed to accomplish the research properly.
  %we show how our research finding will benefit; the hardware startups and the upcoming researchers (show it and say it).\\
- Future work:`<br />`
  This paper propose the significant factors that caused the failure of hardware startups. However, we could still improve the database, the process and the research's keywords by adding: video and audio to the database, failure factors of content analysis to the process, and IoT, AI startups to the research's keywords.
- keywords: hardware startups, failure factors, Gray literature, case study.

This Figure represent Gilgamesh Demo showing how we process our the database in Gilgamesh, using  Theranos as an exemplar case. The whole image represent Theranos document, this is  how our the data looks like,then  the right side of the image represent the coding stripe and in the left side we have the coding for selected item for example we can highlighted the failure factors, product information, Co-Founder, Stage-Fate of the product, Raise CAP, Founded, Founder, Official Website, Services. `<br /><br />`

#### This project named after Gilgamesh

Gilgamesh was a hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology and the protagonist of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late 2nd millennium BC. He was possibly a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was posthumously deified. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) (henceforth ED), c. 2900 – 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 – c. 2004 BC).
