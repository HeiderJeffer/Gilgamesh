## Problem and Motivation

The research question addressed in this paper is:\
R.Q.: Why Do Hardware Startups Fail?\
Research Objective:\
Developing sets of logical steps and rules\
To Process, Collect, Analyze, Manage & Extract the Failure Factors from
Any Given Data Size, Structure, and Formats

Startups are projects to create products or services and look for
ongoing business models to sell the product and profit from it under
uncertainty and extreme.

Hardware startups are startups that build everything that has mass and
volume that is physically tangible.

Hardware startups often failed, it is hard to find successful hardware
startups to start with, however Theranos was a successful hardware
startup, valued at 9 billion U.S dollar. Theranos would be an ideal case
study for a successful hardware startup, but, like most hardware
startups, Theranos ended in a tragic drama.

Theranos's story is the lesson that every hardware startup must learn .
The fall of Theranos is the story of the failure for the most hardware
startups that based on individual convenience, intuition, or
trial-and-error, without any theoretical foundation, scientific models,
or scientific paper.

Repeating the failures is that every hardware startup must be aware of,
especially in the last years, when we have noticed a famous companies
like Intel and Lenovo are leaning toward the hardware startups and
supporting the startups around the globe to build their own hardware.

Putting the hardware startups on the right track requires hard work,
time, and effort that I put in this research, to develop a methodology
and plan to process any given data with any size, types of structure and
format to the answer for the research question that we addressed in this
paper (Why hardware startups fail).

##  Research Process and results

I developed a Startups Diagram, this diagram defines the startups,
startups failures, hardware startups and hardware startups failures. The
Startups Diagram will help us to develop a strategy to identify the
hardware startup failure product and distinguished it from other
startups.

### Data collection and data analysis

I developed strategy to collect and process the data on hardware
startups failure from Gray Literature and CB-Insights.

I developed a strategy to process the data with three phases to answer
the research question (why hardware startups fail). Phase 1 is for data
collection. Phase 2 is for data analysis. Finally Phase 3 is for storing
the research materials. I explain the three phases of the strategy in
the following steps:

**Phase 1: Data Collection**\
Step 1: Define and refine search keywords for Google. Result \[(1,3,6)
Keywords distributed in (Block1, Block2, Block3)\] respectively.\
Step 2: Apply search keywords to the Google search engine. Result
\[43,000,000 units of data\]\
Step 3: Export search results. Result \[580 URLs\].\
Step 4: Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to \[Search Results
Collection A\]. Result \[122 URLs\].\
Step 5: Identify Relevant URLs from \[Search Results Collection B\].
Result \[70 Documents\].\
Step 6: Extract Relevant Cases From \[Document Collection\]. \[Result 18
Cases\].\
Step 7: Include Cases from CB-Insights. Result \[24 Cases\].\
Step 8: Add Case Collection B to Case Collection A. Result \[42
cases\].\
Step 9: Merge the Duplicate Cases in \[Case Collection G\]. Result \[38
Cases\].

**Phase 2: Data Analysis**\
Step 10: Extract the relevant data from \[Case Collection C\]. Result
\[Hardware Startups Information\].\
Step 11: Coding \[Case Collection C\] to identify the failure factors.
Result \[17 Failure Factors\].\
Step 12: Group \[17 Failure Factors\] in categories. Result \[5 Major
Categories\].

**Phase 3: Gilgamesh**\
I created a repository on GitHub and call it Gilgamesh to store the
research materials. It is an open source.

###  Results and limitations

I find 17 major failure factors. I extracted the 17 failure factors from
38 case study. I grouped the 17 failure factors into five major failure
factors category (Customer and Market, Hardware Products and Experts,
Financial, Lack Business Model, and Legal Issues).

The 17 failures factors is the answer of the research question that I
addressed in this study (Why Hardware Startups Fail). I explained with
more details every failure factor with at least one exemplar case.

I find that, Product strategy mistakes, Pricing Cost Issues, Poor
Product are the most critical hardware startup failure factors. I
provide a guideline for the Data Collection and Data Analysis. This
guideline will benefit future researchers and encourage them to
contribute to this study.

I put my theoretical knowledge into practice to develop strategy to
collect 43,000,000 units of data to be processed and extract the 38 case
studies and from these case studies I extract 17 factors and grouped
them into 5 major categories to answer the research question, I explain
every factor with exemplar case I discussed the most critical factors. I
demonstrate the contribution of my research and a reflection on the
limitation. I collected 58 references, to cite the research.

This research will be exploratory, because of the lack of previous
research studies on hardware startups failure, this challenge determined
the nature of the study and the methodology that we will use to answer
research question. IEEE search engine showing the lack of previous
research studies on hardware startups failure, for the following
research keywords: hardware, startups, fail Therefore, we used Gray
Literature and Self-Reported Data to bypass this lack. However, Gray
Literature and Self-Reported Data Collection limited our research.
