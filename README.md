[Why Hardware Startups Fail.pptx](https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Gilgamesh/files/8622357/Why.Hardware.Startups.Fail.pptx)

**Problem Statement:**
Hardware startups often fail. It is still based on trial-and-error, intuition, and individual convenience, without any scientific paper, scientific models, or theoretical foundation that could address an answer for why hardware startups fail to improve the future of the hardware startups and the startups in general.

**Research objective:**
The major research question answered in this thesis is: why hardware startups fail. This thesis developed strategy to extract the factors that cause the failure of hardware startups.	

**Approach:**

 I used CB-Insights and Gray Literature to collect the secondary data. I developed a strategy to process the data collection and data analysis related to the research question. I include the relevant data and exclude the irrelevant; I used Thematic analysis tools to extract case studies from included data and failure factors from case studies. I extract hardware startup information from the case study. Finally, I grouped the failure factors into identical categories. I store the study material in the research's official repository named Gilgamesh on GitHub.	

**Research Finding:**

: I find Customer & Market, Hardware Product & Experts, Financial, Lack of Business Model, and Legal Issues; are the major categories that cause the failure of hardware startups. Product strategy mistakes is the most frequent fatal failure factor that reflects the complexity of hardware startups. Pricing Cost Issues: is the factor that explains why hardware startups are challenging and often fail.	

**Contribution:**

Lack of previous study can serve as an important opportunity to describe the need for further research. The secondary data of this study can be helpful for IoT, Data Science, companies, and institutions relying on hardware startups or Qualitative Data Analysis. Furthermore, this study also suggests clear guidelines; to follow strategy to process the data to accomplish the thematic analysis.

**Future work:**

I propose the significant factors that caused the failure of hardware startups. However, I could still improve the research depth and width by considering the Thematic Analysis for Video and Audio Data to extract study cases and failure factors from video and audio format and adjusting search keywords of the Gray Literature to include the A.I. and IoT hardware startups in the data collection.

**Gilgamesh Exemplar case Theranos hardware startups data analytic, using Nvivo 12 software qualitative data analysis**

This Figure represent Gilgamesh Demo showing how we process our the database in Gilgamesh, using  Theranos as an exemplar case. The whole image represent Theranos document, this is  how our the data looks like,then  the right side of the image represent the coding stripe and in the left side we have the coding for selected item for example we can highlighted the failure factors, product information, Co-Founder, Stage-Fate of the product, Raise CAP, Founded, Founder, Official Website, Services.

**This project named after Gilgamesh**

Gilgamesh was a hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology and the protagonist of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late 2nd millennium BC. He was possibly a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was posthumously deified. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) (henceforth ED), c. 2900 – 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 – c. 2004 BC).
