- Theranos hardware startups data analytic, using Nvivo 12 software qualitative data analysis
- This Figure represent Gilgamesh Demo showing how we process our the database in Gilgamesh, using  Theranos as an exemplar case. The whole image represent Theranos document, this is  how our the data looks like,then  the right side of the image represent the coding stripe and in the left side we have the coding for selected item for example we can highlighted the failure factors, product information, Co-Founder, Stage-Fate of the product, Raise CAP, Founded, Founder, Official Website, Services.

# Overview
Gilgamesh is an open source project using Nvivo 12. Gilgamesh  is the laboratory part for research study developed by Heider Jeffer and Supervised by  Prof. Xiao. In the Gilgamesh project, we used Nvivo 12 software to process the data that we collected; our data are cases that represent hardware startups that failed and opinions from experts on why hardware startups fail. We collected these data from CB-Insights and Gray Literature. We used Nvivo 12 to process Thematic Analysis  (Qualitative Data Analysis)  on these data to drive the failure factors that caused the death of this hardware. We organized and re-group these failure factors into categories and classes. We checked out forward-backward every failure factor to put it in a categorized group that we created to where it belongs. These failure factors are the  answer to our worth-asking research question: 'Why do hardware startups fail'
# This project named after Gilgamesh 
Gilgamesh was a hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology and the protagonist of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late 2nd millennium BC. He was possibly a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was posthumously deified. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) (henceforth ED), c. 2900 – 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 – c. 2004 BC).
