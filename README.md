# Abstract
## Problem Statement:
Hardware startups often fail. It is still based on indi-vidual convenience, intuition, or trial-and-error, without any theoretical foun-dation, scientific models, or scientific paper that could address why hardwarestartups fail, which help to learn from the failures of the past to improve thefuture of the hardware startups.
## Research objective:
The  major  research  question  that is  answered  in thisthesis is; why do hardware startups fail. This thesis achieved the factors thatcause the failure of the hardware startups.
## Approach:
In the initial step, we collect the data from we collect the datafrom Gray Literature. These data represent case studies and content analysis;we used QDA (Qualitative Data Analysis Thematic analysis) to process thesedata.  The  final  step  is  called  ’Gilgamesh’  which  we  process  the  case  studiesand contents analysis; the outcome of this process is new factors that causethe  failure  of  hardware  startups,  new  failure  factors  will  be  categorized  intoidentical groups. Finally, we stored new outcomes in the Gilgamesh database.
## Research Finding:
Customer & Market, Hardware Product & Experts, Fi-nancial, Lack Business Model, and Legal Issue; are the major categories thatcause the failure of the hardware startups. Product strategy mistakes are themost frequent fatal failure factor that reflects the complexity of hardware star-tups.  Pricing  Cost  Issues  is  the  factor  that  explains  in  detail  why  hardwarestartups are challenging and often fail.
## Contribution:In this paper, we propose the significant factors that cause thefailure of hardware startups. These factors will help to improve the future ofhardware startups. The uniqueness and originality of this paper will benefit theupcoming researchers on their related work. A large number of databases in thispaper can be helpful for IoT, Data science, companies, and institutions relyingon hardware startups or Qualitative Data Analysis. Furthermore, this paperalso suggests clear guidelines to follow on the database process to accomplishthe  thematic  analysis  and  the  equipment  needed  to  accomplish  the  researchproperly.
## Future work:We propose the unique factors that caused the failure of hard-ware startups. However, we could still improve these factors by adding videoand audio as qualitative data and processing the Gray Literature content ana-lysis that we stored in the database

- This Figure represent Gilgamesh Demo showing how we process our the database in Gilgamesh, using  Theranos as an exemplar case. The whole image represent Theranos document, this is  how our the data looks like,then  the right side of the image represent the coding stripe and in the left side we have the coding for selected item for example we can highlighted the failure factors, product information, Co-Founder, Stage-Fate of the product, Raise CAP, Founded, Founder, Official Website, Services.

# This project named after Gilgamesh 
Gilgamesh was a hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology and the protagonist of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late 2nd millennium BC. He was possibly a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was posthumously deified. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) (henceforth ED), c. 2900 – 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 – c. 2004 BC).
