##  Overview    
Gilgamesh is an open source project using Nvivo 12. Gilgamesh  is the laboratory part for research study developed by Heider Jeffer and Supervised by  Prof. Xiao. In the Gilgamesh project, we used Nvivo 12 software to process the data that we collected; our data are cases that represent hardware startups that failed and opinions from experts on why hardware startups fail. We collected these data from CB-Insights and Gray Literature. We used Nvivo 12 to process Thematic Analysis  (Qualitative Data Analysis)  on these data to drive the failure factors that caused the death of this hardware. We organized and re-group these failure factors into categories and classes. We checked out forward-backward every failure factor to put it in a categorized group that we created to where it belongs. These failure factors are the  answer to our worth-asking research question: 'Why do hardware startups fail'
