#### Abstract
This thesis addresses the high failure rate of hardware startups, which is often driven by trial-and-error methods and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. The primary research question is: Why do hardware startups fail? The study aims to identify the factors contributing to the failure of hardware startups through a systematic data collection and analysis process.

#### Research Objective
The main goal is to develop a strategy to extract failure factors from various data sources. The study focuses on analyzing secondary data from CB-Insights and gray literature to identify and categorize these factors.

#### Methodology
The research process involves three phases:
1. **Data Collection:** Using predefined keywords to search and gather data from Google and CB-Insights.
2. **Data Analysis:** Coding and categorizing the collected data to identify failure factors.
3. **Data Storage:** Storing the research material in an open-source repository named Gilgamesh on GitHub.

#### Key Findings
The study identifies 17 major failure factors, which are grouped into five categories:
1. **Customer & Market**
2. **Hardware Product & Experts**
3. **Financial Issues**
4. **Lack of Business Model**
5. **Legal Issues**

Critical factors include product strategy mistakes, pricing issues, and poor product quality.

#### Contributions
- The study highlights the need for further research in the field of hardware startup failures.
- Provides a systematic approach for data collection and analysis that can benefit future research.
- Suggests guidelines for improving the depth and width of research by including video and audio data and adjusting search keywords.

#### Limitations
- The study relies on secondary data from gray literature and self-reported sources, which may limit the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the findings.
- There is a lack of previous research on hardware startup failures, making this an exploratory study.

#### Future Work
- Expand data collection to include video and audio formats.
- Adjust search keywords to encompass a broader range of hardware startups, including IoT devices.

#### Thesis Structure
1. **Introduction:** Discusses the problem, motivation, research process, and results.
2. **Background and Related Work:** Provides definitions and context for hardware startups and their failures.
3. **Research Approach:** Details the data collection, analysis methods, and the Gilgamesh repository.
4. **Research Findings:** Presents the identified failure factors and categorizes them.
5. **Discussion:** Analyzes the most critical failure factors and the limitations of the study.
6. **Conclusions and Implications for Future Research:** Summarizes the findings and suggests directions for further research.

### Conclusion
This thesis contributes to understanding why hardware startups fail by identifying key failure factors and providing a methodological approach for future research. It emphasizes the importance of a structured data collection and analysis process and suggests potential improvements for future studies.
